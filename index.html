        <h3>Memory Lane</h3>
        <p>Mortal Kombat propelled itself into the spotlight due to the controversial nature of the game.
           Specifically, the game allowed you to perform a "Fatality," which required the user to Entire
           a secret button combination to perform violent finishing moves on his/her dazed opponent. Kids 
           would read through their favorite gaming magazines looking secret moves. Whoever found them first
           would bring their hand-written notes and let other kids in class copy them.
        </p>
        <p>Back then, video games were released in arcades months before they were released on home console.
           Sometimes you'd be lucky enough to find an empty arcade cabinet, but more often than not there would 
           already be a few players at the machine. Some of these players played like experts. They knew every 
           move, secret stage finishers, how to fight hidden characters, and how to easily take down the end 
           bosses in the game. We would hurry and read the character's ending as fast as we could so we could 
           tell our friends what happens for each character.
        </p>
        <p>Mortal Kombat was more than just a violent video game. It was a game full of hidden secrets and easter
           eggs. It had interesting characters with back stories as if it was its own comic book universe.
        </p>
        <h3>The Strategy Guide</h3>
        <p>Gaming strategy guides were popular items before the internet became a common household service.
           These guides touched on everything that made the game interesting. They contained all of the special 
           moves, finshing moves, biographies, and character endings. They went through the meaning of all of the 
           hidden messages within the game and even discussed rumors. Friends and I would buy these guides and 
           read through them looking for anything that we may have missed.
        </p>
        <h3>About This Application</h3>
        <p>When I was a kid, I would often start designing my own strategy guides using colored pens. I loved
           the idea of digging into the game myself and trying to find my own secret combinations. I would read
           through the end credits hoping to find a subtle hint that others may have missed. I never did finish a 
           guide, but better late than never.
        </p>
        <p>I am currently studying Front End Web Development and I couldn't think of a better project to marry my 
           learning efforts with my interests. I've had a blast designing this application. I hope that this offers
           a sense of nostalgia to those who find it.

          <p>For ages, it was a competition of honor and glory. Noble warriors from
            all around the globe were invited tot ake part, each seeking to win the 
           title of Grand Champion.</p>
          <p>But that was a long time ago... before the tournament was corrupted by
            the evil demon Shang Tsung; A warrior who took not only the lives of his 
            opponents, but their very souls.</p>
          <p>With the aid of his pupil, Goro (A hideous half-human dragon), Tsung began
            a domination of the contest which has lasted for centuries. Today, 500 
            years later, the contest begins anew as warriors once again gather to 
            partake in Mortal Kombat.</p>

            500 years. He won the title of Grand Champion by defeating Kung Lao, A 
            Shaolin Fighting monk. It was during this period that the tournament fell 
            into Shang Tsung's hands and was corrupted.</p>
